# Commute-Tracker
This app allows you to track how long your commutes to work daily are taking.

# How to Use
1. Tab over to settings and enter in your normal commute, starting with your home address. Once you press search, the app
will search both addresses to make sure they are valid. The app will then display your morning and evening commutes.

2. Tab over to 'Start Trip' before you are about to start a morning or evening commute. The addresses will automatically be 
reversed based on if it's a morning or evening commute, from there just press Start commute when you leave and press Finish
Commute when you arrive at work.

3. You'll be able to see your trips in the 'Logs' tab. Tapping on each row will bring up more details about trip, like
when it started and how long google maps thought it would take at the time.

# Future Improvements
Hoping to add functionality to kick off a trip session by when the phone connects to bluetooth, so that you don't have to 
remember to press start and end trip.
